    POC showing a simple use case for
    BeaEngine (https://github.com/BeaEngine/beaengine)
    patched to compile on Linux kernel (https://github.com/carloslack/beaengine/tree/hack-da-shit-out-of-it)

    In this example it displays up to JMPLEN bytes of given kernel function, broken down
    by instruction sets - useful if you want to function trampoline in kernel.
